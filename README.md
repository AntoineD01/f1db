## F1 Stats Project

### Overview
The F1 Stats Project is a Python project focused on analyzing Formula 1 data. It includes functionality for parsing and processing YAML files containing information about F1 circuits, constructors, drivers, and more. The project showcases advanced proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, and performance optimization techniques.

### Features
- **File Management:** Efficiently reads YAML files containing F1 data using the `yaml` library.
- **Data Parsing:** Parses YAML data into Python dictionaries for easy manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Search:** Implements search functionality to find specific circuits or constructors within the dataset.
- **Fuzzy String Matching:** Incorporates fuzzy string matching algorithms to handle close matches in user input.

### Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point of the project. Contains the main functionality and user interaction.
- `file_management.py`: Module for file handling operations, including reading YAML files and extracting data.
- `features.py`: Module containing various features such as searching for circuits and constructors.
- `data`: Directory containing YAML files with F1 data.

### Usage
- Run `main.py` and follow the prompts to interact with the project features.
- Explore the different modules to understand the implementation details and extend functionality as needed.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `yaml`: Python library for parsing YAML files.
- `fuzzywuzzy`: Python library for fuzzy string matching algorithms.
